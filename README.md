DEEP LEARNING-DRIVEN MRI IMAGE SEGMENTATION AND CLASSIFICATION FOR BRAIN TUMORS USING RF,SVM,YOLO5, AND U-NET ARCHITECTURES
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI scan images using Machine Learning techniques. The system analyzes medical images and predicts whether a tumor is present, helping support early diagnosis.

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to build an automated image classification model that can assist in identifying brain tumors accurately and efficiently.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Machine Learning
* TensorFlow / Keras (or specify what you used)
* OpenCV
* NumPy & Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

MRI brain scan images were used to train and test the model. The dataset contains images categorized as:

* Tumor
* No Tumor

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Image preprocessing and resizing
2. Feature extraction from MRI images
3. Model training using machine learning algorithms
4. Prediction of tumor presence based on trained model

## 📊 Results

The trained model achieved good classification performance in detecting brain tumors from MRI scans.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Improve model accuracy using deep learning architectures
* Deploy as a web application
* Add real-time prediction interface
